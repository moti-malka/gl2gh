# Services Layer - To be implemented

This directory will contain business logic services:

- `project_service.py` - Migration project CRUD operations
- `connection_service.py` - Credential management with encryption
- `run_service.py` - Migration run orchestration
- `event_service.py` - Event logging and streaming
- `artifact_service.py` - Artifact storage and retrieval

Services abstract database operations and provide business logic layer between API and database.
